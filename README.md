# CHAIN NUCLEAR REACTION
This is a project which simulates
chain neutron decay of uranium.
Opening this program you'll see metal crystal lattice:
 uranium atoms (orange ones), 
 neutrons (white ones),
 other atoms aren't shown.

#### The precise reactions can be:
```
U-235 + n ===> Ba-144 + Kr-90 + 2n + about 200 MeV
U-235 + n ===> Ba-141 + Kr-92 + 3n + also about 200 MeV
```
#### Something like this:
![Uranium](/images/decay.jpg)
#### In real life it looks like this:
![Nagasaki](/images/n.jpg)
#### Dependencies:
```
cmake SDL2
```
#### Precompiled binaries for windows:
[WINDOWS](/WIN_BIN/)
#### Program management keyboard keys:
```
'q' - exit
```
